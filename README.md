# MIT Battlecode 2023

We competed in MIT Battlecode ([EECS 6.9610](%5B6.9610%5D%28http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m6e.html%29)) during MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP) in January 2023. Battlecode is MIT's premier programming competition where students develop A.I. for virtual robots in a real-time strategy game. Read more about this year's game here: [Battlecode 2023](https://battlecode.org). 

We competed in three tournaments, including Sprint 1 (Jan. 17), Sprint 2 (Jan. 24) and finally the U.S. Qualifiers (Jan. 30). As freshman in college, we placed 25th in the 96-team qualifying tournament for U.S. college students. You can view the U.S. Qualifiers bracket [here](https://challonge.com/bc23usaquals/standings) and livestreams of all the tournaments [here](https://www.twitch.tv/mitbattlecode/videos?filter=all&sort=time). 

The robots that play in the game are programmed in Java. You can find our final submitted code in [`src/USQualifiers`](src/USQualifiers/). We wrote a lot of code to make this work, and are very proud of what we accomplished!

## About Us

Our team name is a spin-off from the name of the University of Massachusetts Amherst library, the DuBois library, and MIT's mascot, Tim the Beaver.

## Fun Fact
We wanted to give our robots personality, so we made them print out messages on their death. Here's a list of the messages that robots may print out when they die (these are in [`src/USQualifiers/RobotPlayer.java`](https://github.com/beaverbois/battlecode23/blob/5eb3f99c093db80ed73e5f901d656520c5691b76/src/USQualifiers/RobotPlayer.java)):
