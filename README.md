# MIT Battlecode 2023

We competed in MIT Battlecode ([EECS 6.9610](%5B6.9610%5D%28http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m6e.html%29)) during MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP) in January 2023. Battlecode is MIT's premier programming competition where students develop A.I. for virtual robots in a real-time strategy game. Read more about this year's game here: [Battlecode 2023](https://battlecode.org). 

We competed in three tournaments, including Sprint 1 (Jan. 17), Sprint 2 (Jan. 24) and finally the U.S. Qualifiers (Jan. 30). As freshman, we placed 25th in the 96-team qualifying tournament for U.S. college students.
